Each lead time is uniformly distributed across a range of 1 to $k=20$ days, reflecting the uncertainty in delivery times. Let $Y$ denote the minimum delivery time among all suppliers. Understanding the distribution of $Y$ is crucial for assessing the earliest possible time you can begin production.

We record this maximum for each collective delivery.\n",
